Presentation
------------
Lidy is a small cross-platform C library for sparse matrices handling distributed under LPGL license. This software requires the [libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) libary for loading and saving sparse matrices in XML file format. Sparse matrices are implemented using simple linked lists and usual matrix operations are available: addition, subtraction, (scalar) multiplication, division, transposition and exponentiation.

Compiling
---------
Once the archive decompressed, open a terminal and type `make`. Then, indicate the path of the "lib" directory with the environment variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" by typing `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:directory_of_the_project/lib`. Examples illustrating the features implemented in the library are provided in the "examples" directory".

Documentation
-------------
The LaTeX / HTML documentation in the "doc" directory can be generated by typing `make doc` in a terminal.
