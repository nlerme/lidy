Presentation
------------
Lidy is a small cross-platform C library for sparse matrices handling distributed under LPGL license. Sparse matrices are implemented using simple linked lists and usual matrix operations are available:

* Addition.
* Subtraction.
* (Scalar) multiplication.
* Division.
* Transposition.
* Exponentiation.

Requirements
------------
* The [libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) libary for loading and saving sparse matrices in XML file format.

Compilation
-----------
Once the archive decompressed, just type `make` in a terminal. Then, indicate the path of the "lib" directory with the environment variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" by typing `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:directory_of_the_project/lib`.

Execution
---------
Examples illustrating the features implemented in the library are provided in the "examples" directory.

Documentation
-------------
The LaTeX / HTML documentation in the "doc" directory can be generated by typing `make doc` in a terminal.
