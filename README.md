Lidy is a small cross-platform C library for sparse matrices handling distributed under LPGL license. This software requires the [libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) libary for loading and saving sparse matrices in XML file format. Sparse matrices are implemented using simple linked lists and usual matrix operations are available: addition, subtraction, (scalar) multiplication, division, transposition and exponentiation.

Documentation
